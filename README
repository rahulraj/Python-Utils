This repo contains some code that reduces boilerplate when writing Python.
Currently three utilities are implemented:

with_getters_for - a function that adds getter functions to objects
assign_injectables - a function to populate a constructor that uses dependency
                     injection
MethodMissing - a mixin class that implements Ruby's method_missing in Python
